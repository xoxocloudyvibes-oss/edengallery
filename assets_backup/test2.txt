Welcome to Frequency Reset – The Science of Silence.

Frequency Reset is a specialized audio laboratory dedicated to providing relief for the Tinnitus and Hyperacusis community. While general relaxation apps offer generic sounds, we provide engineered acoustic environments designed to facilitate habituation and provide immediate masking relief.

Why Frequency Reset?

Most Tinnitus sufferers find "white noise" too harsh. We focus on High-Fidelity Notched Audio, Deep Brown Noise, and Linear Soundscapes that gently "blanket" your internal ringing without overstimulating your auditory nerves.

Our Content Library includes:

Targeted Maskers: Frequencies calibrated for specific ringing pitches (from $4000\text{ Hz}$ to $12000\text{ Hz}$).

Dark-Screen Sleep Aids: 10-hour videos with zero blue light to help you fall—and stay—asleep.

Habituation Training: Layered nature sounds designed to retrain your brain to ignore the signal.

Lossless Audio Quality: Clean, artifact-free sound to prevent ear fatigue.

Reclaim your focus. Reset your ears. Find your quiet.
